# noodles

This is just a fun side project I'm working on in an effort to try and teach myself some handy dandy tools. 

Currently, I'm planning on using:  
  - Mongoose
  - Express
  - React
  - Node 
  - Socket.io
  
  
  The plan is to make a simple tree of comments. I got the idea from working on a final project, where I had a lot of fun just posting random comments for my friends to read when I wanted them to help me verify that my deployment was working as intended.
